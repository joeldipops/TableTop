# TableTop
A collection of table-top game ideas and prototypes

## Resource War

Magic-esque TCG prototype.  Uses resource points that accrue over time over time instead of Mana draws.  Victory through taking from a shared pool of Victory points rather than depleting your opponents Life.

## Laundry Day

3-4 player party board game with action economy.  Themed around getting your own washing dry with limited line-space and inclement weather.
