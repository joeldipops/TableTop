# Rules for playing Resource War 

## Objective
Have more victory points (V) than your opponent when the *Pool* runs dry.

## Cards
All cards have a cost in R written in the top left corner that must be paid before the card can be played.
After this, the card will remain in play unti a *Conflict* or *Effect* causes it to be discarded.
Once a card is in play, any effect of that card can be activated at any time that you have *priority*, as long as you can pay the effect cost, if any, or the effect description says otherwise.

### Effects
If a card effect has a cost or costs, it will be written as such.
_Cost 1; Cost 2; etc: Effect_

### Types
There are three types of card, Animates, Structures and Tools.  Cards have one or more subtypes, the name of a card is considered a subtype.  For example, the Sargeant card's type is Animate and its subtypes are Soldier and Sargeant.

* Animates: Animates can confront, attack and defend.  They have Wit, Power and Defence points.
* Structures: Cannot attack or defend, but can be attacked.  They have Power and Defence points.
* Tools: Tools can only be plaed if there is an animate to give them to. Tools with a given subtype eg "Thieves' tool" can only be given to animates with that subtype, "Thief".  Otherwise a Tool can be given to any Animate.  The Animate a tool is given to is called its "User".  If an animate is discarded, any tools they have are also discarded, unless an effect says otherwise.



## Setup
- Each player builds a deck of 40 cards which is then shuffled.
- Assign space for the *Pool*, the *Play* area, each player's *Discard* and each player's *Victory* tokens.
- Place 30V tokens in the shared *Pool*
- Decide who is going first.
- Give Player One 1 Resource Point (R) token.
- Give Player Two 3R tokens.

## Each Turn
1. Draw Step
    1. Get +4R
    2. Draw 1 card from your deck.
2. Play Step
    1. Carry out any actions demanded of you from cards in play.
    2. Choose whether or not to play a card from your hand, pay its cost and put it in play.
    3. Wait for your opponent to respond by activating the effects of any of their cards in play.
    4. You may also activate your own effects in response to your opponent's effects and so on.
    5. Repeat these steps as many times as you want and can.
3. Conflict Step
    1. If it's the first turn of the game, skip this step.
    2. Choose any *Animate* that is not already involved in conflict.
    3. Choose whether to use this Animate to
        - *Confront* an opponent's *Animate*
        - *Attack* an opponent's *Structure*
        - *Attack* your opponent directly.
    4. Announce the Animate and the Target of the conflict.
    5. Repeat for as many of your Animates as you want.
    6. Wait for your opponent to activate the effects of any of their cards in play.
    7. You may also activate your own effects in response to your opponent's effects and so on.
    8. Wait for your opponent to choose how they want to defend, and resolve effects as above.
    9. Decide in what order you will damage any defenders.
    10. Resolve the outcome of all conflicts.
4. End Step
    1. Perform any actions required by card effects.

## Confrontations
When an Animate confronts another, compare the WIT points of both animates.  

- If the confronter's WIT is equal, the confrontation ends.
- If the confronter's WIT is 1-3 points higher, the other animate cannot confront, attack or use any of its effects until the end of its controller's next turn.
- If the confronter's WIT is 4 or more points higher, the other animate is discarded. 

## Attacks

Any attack can be against any of your opponent's structures or against the opponent directly.
Attacks work more or less the same as in MTG, except Structures can be specifically targeted.

1. Declare which Animate will attack and what they will be attacking.
2. You opponent chooses any number of their animates to defend.  An Animate can only defend once per turn.
3. Subtract the Defense of the attacker from the total Power of all the defenders, including the structure itself.
    - If the result is greater than 0, you will discard the attacker.
4. Distribute the attacker's power as damage to the defenders.  If the damage assigned to a defender is greater than its Defense, the defender will be discarded.
5. Subtract the total Defense of all the defenders from the Power of the attacker.  If the result is greater than 0, assign this damage to the target.
    - If the damage to a structure is greater than its Defense, it is discarded.
    - If there is any direct damage to your opponent, take that amount as VP from the *Pool*.
