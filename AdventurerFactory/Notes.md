Ideas:

* Make Encounters cost XP, so you don't always have too much.
* Cost XP to use any effects of spells etc
* Stamina stat (used to attack) that you have to charge up with XP
Sword breaker -> Equal or Higher, not just higher.
Need a boring card that can heal Willpower
Make Ork more expensive since it buffs attack?
More cards use Willpower as a resource?
If you have 1 card out, you get 2XP instead of 1?
Health Potion should be more expensive or heal less HP
Clarify what happens when you try to play a card with an inventory slot with a card in it that says "This card cannot be discarded"
The games are usually over before 
What happens if you have two weapons out? Kyle thinks add some chip damage.
No HP AND Willpower, but still two ways to attack (Defense blocks attach, Charisma blocks Charisma)
