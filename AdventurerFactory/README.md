## Equipment

## Setup

2 Player 1 takes 1 XP
3 Player 2 takes 3 XP
4 Each deck is shuffled and each player draws 6 cards.

## Phases each Turn
### Resource Step
1 Take 2XP
2 Draw 1 card

### Main step
As many times as you like / can afford do the following.
- Play a card
    1 Check whether any requirements to play the card are met.  These are represented by the symbols in the top left of the card.
        - Requirements have different categories eg C - Class, R - Race and different 
        .................
    1 Pay the card's cost (usually by removing an amount of your XP).  This is the large number appearing in the centre of the card. 
    2 A card may have 0 - 4 _Slots_ (symbols on top left of the card). Choose which _Slot_ you will play it in.
    3 If the card has no Slot, place the card in front of you and skip to Step 6.
    4 Check whether there is already a card in the card's _Slot_ and if so, Discard it
    5 Place the card in front of you and position it according to the slot you choose.
        - If there's only one slot, place it vertically.
        - Otherwise, for the left-most slot, place it horizontally with the top of the left.
        - For the second slot from the left, place it straight up
        - For the right-most slot, place it horizontally with top to the right.
        - And if there are four slots, for the second-slot to the right, place it on any 45 degree angle.
        - (Or track this some other way, I don't care, the important thing is each slot can only have one thing in it.
    6 Allow your opponent to respond with one of their actions.
    7 Respond in turn and so on....

- Perform an action.
    Actions are what is written on the cards you have in play, in the format **Cost 1_; Cost 2_ : Effect**
    If an action has no cost, it will start with a colon ':'
    - Pay the cost
    - Perform the action
    - Allow your opponent to respond with an action and so on...

### Encounter Step


# Random Notes
DnD inspired LCG

- Each deck represents a single Player Character
- Will involve dice in someway...bounded accuracy type thing.  Probably no attack roles though.
- Victory condition involves sending HP to 0.  Entertaining idea of some kind of death save additional requirement.
- Will involve stats that can be built up, but not too many.  Defence will be a definite, not sure what else.

## Card types
### Classes
- Determine what class feature cards are available to you
- First class feature played determines your starting class
- Additional class cards are required to multiclass (ie play features from other classes) or level-up ie play features with a certain level requirement.
- Levels will only go as high as 3 or 4 obvs, not 20.
### Features
- Bread and butter of what you can do
#### Class Features
- 
#### Racial features
- Divided in to sub-types representing fantasy races
- No more than two races allowed per character.
- Probably some exceptions or ways to change what's available.
### Consumables
- Used once and discarded.
### Equipables
- Armour, weapons, spells, tools.
- Slots for each kind of equipable.
    - eg. Head, left hand, right hand, gloves, etc.
    - If you play one when no slot is available, discard exising.
