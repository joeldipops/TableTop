# Adventurer Factory

## Goal
Deplete opponents _Health_ (ðŸ’—) or _Willpower_ (âš¡) to 0 by building a powerful character and then using his or her best abilities.

## Summary
The basic idea is as you play, you will fill out your hypothetical character sheet with Class and Race abilities, fill out your item slots with equipment, and level up allowing you to play more effective abilities or equip more powerful equipment. At the same time, you will be using what abilities you have to either beat down an opponent or send them packing via a more diplomatic route.

Once you play a card that is associated with a given Class or Race, your character becomes that Class/Race. Once you have a Class, you can't generally play cards associated with other Classes unless you play _Type_ cards that can open up new Class options (eg "Multiclassing") or increase the level of a class you already have. This allows for the concept of Mono- or Multi- colour decks as in MTG.

On the other hand, you also have Equipment slots to manage.  Certain cards may require that you have a free hand, or not be wearing any Armour.  When playing a card like this, you can discard what you already have in order to play the new card in that slot.  The system is extensible, you don't have a limited set of slots, but cards that share a given symbol cannot be played together.

## Equipment

- 40 Card Deck per player.
- Set of D&D dice ie. d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20
- Some way to keep track of Experience (ðŸŒˆ), Health (ðŸ’—) and Willpower (âš¡)
### Optional
- Something to track your _Violence Die_ and _Diplomacy Die_.
- Something to track _Attack_ (ðŸ’ª), _Defense_ (â›Š) and _Charisma_ (ðŸŽµ)
      bonuses + any other card-specific resources.

## Setup
1. Each player starts with 30 ðŸ’— and 30 âš¡
2. Each Players starts with a Violence and Diplomacy Die of 1d1 (that is, a flat 1 damage)
2. Player 1 takes 3 ðŸŒˆ
3. Player 2 takes 5 ðŸŒˆ
4. Each deck is shuffled and each player draws 6 cards.

## Phases each Turn
### Resource Step
1. Take 1ðŸŒˆ for each card you have in play.
2. Draw 1 card if possible.

### Main step
As many times as you like / can afford do the following.
- Play a card
    1. Check whether the card has any `Needs` listed.  The card cannot be played unless all `Needs` are met.
        - For example, your only card in play is `Knight` which provides `1xKnight`.  In your hand, you have `Silent Steps`, which needs 1x`Assasin`,`Silver Ring` which has no needs,  `Squire` which needs 1x`Knight` and  `Knightly Banner` which needs `2xKnight`.  You may play `Silver Ring` or `Squire`, but you may not play `Silent Steps` or `Knightly Banner`.        
    2. Pay the card's cost in ðŸŒˆ 
    2. A card may have 0 - 4 _Slots_ (symbols on top left of the card). Choose which _Slot_ you will play it in.
    3. If the card has no Slot, place the card in front of you and skip to Step 6.
    4. Check whether there is already a card in the card's _Slot_ and if so, Discard it
    5. Place the card in front of you and position it according to the slot you choose.
        - If there's only one slot, place it vertically.
        - Otherwise, for the left-most slot, place it horizontally with the top of the left.
        - For the second slot from the left, place it straight up
        - For the right-most slot, place it horizontally with top to the right.
        - And if there are four slots, for the second-slot to the right, place it on any 45 degree angle.
        - (Or track this some other way, I don't care, the important thing is each slot can only have one thing in it.
    6. Allow your opponent to respond with one of their actions.
    7. Respond in turn and so on....

- Perform an action.
    Actions are what is written on the cards you have in play, in the format **Cost 1_; Cost 2_ : Effect**
    If an action has no cost, it will start with a colon ':'
    1. Check that this action can be played - actions can be played once per turn per card.
    2. Pay the cost
    2. If the action was from a consumable, turn it on it's side to indicate it has been used.
    3. Perform the action
    4. Allow your opponent to respond with an action and so on...

### Encounter Step
In the encounter step, you may do one of the following.
- Attack by rolling your _Violence Die_ in order to lower your opponents Health and defeat them in combat.
    - The basic formula is `New ðŸ’— = Old ðŸ’— - (Violence Die + Your ðŸ’ª - Their â›Š)`
    - This is called a Simple Attack
- Roll your _Diplomacy Die_ to lower their Willpower so that they cease hostilities
    - The basic formula is `New âš¡ = Old âš¡ - (Diplomacy Die + Your ðŸŽµ )`
    - This is called a Simple Parley
- Perform the action on a card you have in play that has a cost of "Encounter:"

### Clean up Step
Each player discards any consumables that have been used.

# End Conditions
- When a player has 0 ðŸ’— or 0 âš¡ at the end of a turn.
- When a player has 0 cards in their deck AND did not Play a card on their turn.
- When a player requests a draw at any time and it is accepted by their opponent.
