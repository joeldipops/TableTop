# Adventurer Factory
DnD inspired LCG

- Each deck represents a single Player Character
- Will involve dice in someway...bounded accuracy type thing.  Probably no attack roles though.
- Victory condition involves sending HP to 0.  Entertaining idea of some kind of death save additional requirement.
- Will involve stats that can be built up, but not too many.  Defence will be a definite, not sure what else.

## Card types
### Classes
- Determine what class feature cards are available to you
- First class feature played determines your starting class
- Additional class cards are required to multiclass (ie play features from other classes) or level-up ie play features with a certain level requirement.
- Levels will only go as high as 3 or 4 obvs, not 20.
### Features
- Bread and butter of what you can do
#### Class Features
- 
#### Racial features
- Divided in to sub-types representing fantasy races
- No more than two races allowed per character.
- Probably some exceptions or ways to change what's available.
### Consumables
- Used once and discarded.
### Equipables
- Armour, weapons, spells, tools.
- Slots for each kind of equipable.
    - eg. Head, left hand, right hand, gloves, etc.
    - If you play one when no slot is available, discard exising.
