# Adventurer Factory
<em>No-one knew who had cast the spell that caused the ground to crumble and the oceans to swallow the land, but, as everyone said "Well, it certainly wasn't me!"

Mistrust reigned far wider than any King or Empress, and nobody was spared from the fever. Disputes and skirmishes and wars naturally spread across the realm, and even the basest of commoners would preface every greeting and goodbye with a sideways glance.

And so this is how it is when you, a mysterious traveller on a dusty road, chance to meet another.  Who are they?  What are they hiding? **Why are they looking at _you_ like that?**  Should you chase them off, bring them to reason, or simply leave them bleeding on the well trodden dirt?  Or will they get to you first?</em>

## Summary
The cards in your deck reflect the powerful adventurer who you might become.  Draw to fill out your character sheet with Class or Race abilities, gain levels and fill inventory slots with useful equipment or powerful weapons.  Use your skills and resources to surivive encounters with the hostile strangers you meet along your journey to greatness.

### Equipment

- 40 Card Deck per player.
- Set of D&D dice ie. d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20
- Counters for Mind (<img src="./assets/icons/Experience.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" />), Health (ðŸ’—) and Willpower (<img src="./assets/icons/Willpower.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" />) stats.
- Extra counters/tokens for any card specific resources.

### Goal
You win by forcing your opponent to stop the fight.  You can incapacitate them physically, bringing their _Health_ (ðŸ’—) to 0, or use diplomacy, deceit or magic to exhaust their _Willpower_ (<img src="./assets/icons/Willpower.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" />).

### Stats
Here are the stats you'll use as you play. <img src="./assets/icons/Experience.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" />, ðŸ’— and <img src="./assets/icons/Willpower.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" /> must be tracked separately, but ðŸ’ª, â›Š and <img src="./assets/icons/Charisma.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" /> can always be determined from the cards and tokens in play.

- <img src="./assets/icons/Experience.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" /> _Mind_: This represents your ability to learn and concentrate.  It decreases when you expend your focus on new skills, but increases as you put what you've learnt into practice. You accumulate <img src="./assets/icons/Experience.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" /> at the start of each turn and use it to play cards and use actions
-  ðŸ’— _Health_: This is your body's ability to keep fighting. You must keep it above 0 to win the game.
- <img src="./assets/icons/Willpower.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" /> _Willpower_: This is your drive to overcome your opponent. If your Willpower is 0 at the end of a turn, you have given up the fight and the game is over.
- ðŸ’ª _Attack_: Your physical strength and agility.  The higher it is, the great your capacity to reduce an opponent's ðŸ’—.  In most encounters, it is offset by your opponent's â›Š.
- â›Š _Defence_: Your body's ability to dodge attacks or withstand injuries. In most encounters, it reduces the ðŸ’— you lose from an Attack.
- <img src="./assets/icons/Charisma.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" /> _Charisma_: Not every meeting must come to blows.  This is your ability to convince opponents of the strength of your arm or the righteousness of your cause, but also your ability stare down an opponent trying to convince you of their own. The higher it is, the more you can reduce an opponent's <img src="./assets/icons/Willpower.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" />, but can be offset when the opponent's <img src="./assets/icons/Charisma.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" /> is high.

### Needs and Fills
Sorry - TBD


## Setup
1. Each player starts with 20 ðŸ’— and 20 <img src="./assets/icons/Willpower.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" />
2. Each Players starts with an Attack and Parley Die of 1d1 (that is, a flat 1 damage)
2. Player 1 takes 2 <img src="./assets/icons/Experience.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" />
3. Player 2 takes 4 <img src="./assets/icons/Experience.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" />
4. Each deck is shuffled and each player draws 5 cards.

## Phases each Turn
### Resource Step
1. Take 1<img src="./assets/icons/Experience.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" /> for each card you have in play, with a minimum of 1.
2. If you have more than 10<img src="./assets/icons/Experience.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" />, discard the surplus.
3. Draw 1 card if possible.

### Main step
As many times as you like / can afford, do the following.
- Play a card
    1. Check whether the card has any `Needs` listed.  The card cannot be played unless all `Needs` are met.
        - For example, your only card in play is `Knight` which provides `1xKnight`.  In your hand, you have `Silent Steps`, which needs 1x`Assasin`,`Silver Ring` which has no needs,  `Squire` which needs 1x`Knight` and  `Knightly Banner` which needs `2xKnight`.  You may play `Silver Ring` or `Squire`, but you may not play `Silent Steps` or `Knightly Banner`.        
    2. Check what inventory slot/s the card `Fills`, and check whether you already have a card in play that has filled the same slot.
    3. If so, and you still want to play the new card, Discard the existing card in that slot.
    4. Pay the new card's <img src="./assets/icons/Experience.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" /> cost.
    5. Place the card in front of you.
    6. Allow your opponent to respond with one of their actions.
    7. Respond in turn and so on....
    8. Finally, resolve any immediate effects of the new card.

- Perform an action.
    Actions are what is written on the cards you have in play, in the format **_Cost 1_ : Effect**
    If an action has no cost, it will simply start with a colon ':'
    1. Check that this action can be played - actions can only be played once per turn per card with that action.
    2. Pay the cost
    2. If the action was from a `Consumable` card, turn it on its side to indicate it has now been _Consumed_.
    3. Perform the action
    4. Allow your opponent to respond with an action and so on...
 
- Discard one of your in-play cards.
     There may be times when you find it advantageous to remove one of your cards from play.  You may do this on your turn unless a card says otherwise.
     1. Pay 1<img src="./assets/icons/Experience.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" />
     2. Put the card in the discard pile.

### Encounter Step
In the encounter step, you may do one of the following.
- Attack by rolling your _Attack Die_ in order to lower your opponents ðŸ’— and defeat them in combat.
    - The formula is `New ðŸ’— = Old ðŸ’— - (Attack Die + Your ðŸ’ª - Their â›Š)`
    - This is called a Simple Attack
- Roll your _Parley Die_ to lower their Willpower, and give up the fight.
    - The formula is `New <img src="./assets/icons/Willpower.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" /> = Old <img src="./assets/icons/Willpower.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" /> - (Parley Die + Your <img src="./assets/icons/Charisma.png" width="24" height="24" /> - Their <img src="./assets/icons/Charisma.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" />)`
    - This is called a Simple Parley
- Perform the action on a card you have in play that includes a cost of _<ins>Encounter</ins>_:

NB: It is possible to have negative values for ðŸ’ª, â›Š or <img src="./assets/icons/Charisma.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" />, but a Simple Attack or Simple Parley can never add more ðŸ’—/<img src="./assets/icons/Willpower.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" /> rather than reduce it.

### Clean up Step
Each player discards any consumables that have been used.

## End Conditions
- When a player has 0 ðŸ’— or 0 <img src="./assets/icons/Willpower.png" width="24" height="24" align="top" /> at the end of a turn.
- When a player has 0 cards in their deck AND did not Play a card on their turn.
- When a player requests a draw at any time and it is accepted by their opponent.

## Card types
Each card has at least one _Type_ and can have any number beyond that, separated by `/`. 
- The only _Type_ with special rules attached is `Consumable`. After an action from a `Consumable` is used, the card is _Consumed_.  _Consumed_ cards are considered In Play until the following _Clean up Step_, at which point they are Discarded.
