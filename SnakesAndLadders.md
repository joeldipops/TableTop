# Slightly more interesting *Snakes and Ladders* variations

As a kid I had a sweet snakes and ladders board where all the snakes had cheeky little speech bubbles, and one of them was a "Ladder Snake".  Unfortunately as an adult, I can't really enjoy it given the complete lack of decision-making in the game.  Here are some simple changes I came up with to add some strategy and risk/reward without changing the fundamental vibe of the experience too much.

## Dice Pool

- Instead of a single d6, each player has an identical pool of dice.  Fox example { d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 }
- On your turn, roll as many dice as you want and sum the result, then set all rolled dice aside from the pool.
- The pools are reset when all pools are empty.

## Take a step back

- Play on a normal 100-square Snakes and Ladders board.
- Replace the standard d6 with 2d4
- On your turn, before you roll, you may choose to move BACK 1, 2 or 3 spaces.  Ignore snakes or ladders you land on in this step.

### Optional Additions
- If you land on a *Snake* when you move back, follow it. Ladders are still ignored.
- Treat double 4s as 1 instead of 8 to mitigate the fact that with 2d4s you're going to be rolling 6 or higher more than a third of the time despite the fact that the board is "weighted" for a d6
