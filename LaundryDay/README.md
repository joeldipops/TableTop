# Setup
1. Lay out the main board

3. Each player choses a colour and takes all the *Wet Washing* tokens of that colour.
4. Each player shuffles the tokens and puts them in a bag or somewhere they can be drawn from randomly. This is your *Pile*.
5. Each player draws 10 tokens from their *Pile* and puts them infront of them.  These can be kept secret if preferred.  This is your *Basket*

# Gameplay

The game is played across 3 rounds, and the goal is to get as much of the laundry in your *Pile* dry as you can.
Different pieces of laundry award different points, and some pieces have special conditions associated with them.

Each round consists of the following.

1. Roll 1d6, this is *Forecast* die.  Keep a note of what was rolled for the remainder of the round.

| Roll | Forecast |
| :---:  | :---: |
| 1 | Cloudy - higher chance of rain or storm. |
| 2 | " |
| 3 | " |
| 4 | Sunny - low chance of rain. |
| 5 | " |
| 6 | " |

2. Roll dice to determine turn order.
3. Each players takes a turn. They have two action points and may spend them to do any of the following.
| Points | Action |
| :---: | :--- |
| 1 | Move a *Portable Line* and all of the tokens on it from one area to the other. |
| 1 | Draw a random token from the *Pile* and add it to your *Basket*. |
| 1 | Move one token already on a line to another empty space on any line. |
| 2 | Take one token from your basket and place it face up on an empty space on any line. |
| 2 | Take one token down from a line and return it to its owner's *Basket*. |

4. After each player has had a turn, everyone goes again, but in the reverse order.
5. Repeat steps 4 and 5 twice more.

6. For all the lines in the *inside* area:
 1. Take any token that is face down and put it face down in its owner's *Folding*
 2. Flip over any token that is face up and ensure it is put back in the same space.
7. Roll 1d8, this is the *Weather* die.  Compare it with the *Forecast* die to determine the weather.

| Roll | Weather |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1 | Rain |
| 2 | Cloudy |
| 3 | " |
| 4 | " |
| 5 | Sunny |
| 6 | Sunny |
| 7 | Sunny |
| 8 | Sunny |


| Forecast | Weather | Result
| :---:  | :---: |
| Cloudy | Rain  | Thunderstorm |
| Cloudy | Cloudy | Rain |
| Sunny | Rain | Rain |
| Sunny | Cloudy | Light Shower |
| Cloudy | Sunny | Sunny |
| Sunny |  Sunny | Sunny |

8. For all lines that are in the *outside* area, carry out the below depending on the weather.
| Weather | Action |
| Sunny | These clothes have dried quickly in the sun.  Take all tokens and put them face down in to their owners' *Folding*
| Light Shower | These clothes are mostly dry, but are still a little bit damp. The owner may choose to flip the tokens over and return them to the same space or add them to their *Folding* face up.
| Rain | These clothes haven't dried at all. Do nothing.
| Thunderstorm | High wind and driving rain has blown these clothes off the line and in to the mud.  Return them to their owners' *Baskets*

9. Repeat steps 1 - 8 for rounds 2 and 3.

10. Add up the scores and declare a winner.
